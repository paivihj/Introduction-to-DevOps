<ul>
<li>I had heard about DevOps in many different situations, but did not know exactly what it means.</li>
<li>Introduction to DevOps course seemed like a good chance to learn the basics of DevOps and there was not similar course available in Haaga-Helia, where I study.</li>
<li>I have learned quite a lot on this course, even though it is only 2 ECTS. Here a list of things I know (much) more about than before the course:
<ul>
<li>Markdown syntax, I had not used Markdown before</li>
<li>GitHub Pages, I had used GitHub, but not GitHub Pages</li>
<li>More experience with git commands</li>
<li>Hugo, had never even heard of Hugo before</li>
<li>CAMS model, this was completely new thing to me as well</li>
<li>Continuous delivery, some things were familiar already, but got deeper knowledge of this subject</li>
<li>Setting up a webpage is actually quite easy, if it does not involve database or other interactive content!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This project, building a static website with Hugo and publishing it on GitHub Pages, was my favorite part of the course. I think you always learn best by doing. First I had some issues with Hugo, but I think it was mostly because of being a bit lazy and not reading the tutorial material thoroughly enough. In the end, I think Hugo is quite easy and handy tool for setting up a static website, especially if you do not know how/want to do programming.</li>
<li>In the online questionaries, which was another part of the course, there were a few bit unclear questions/answers, but it can well be that I just did not familiarize myself enough with the course material.</li>
