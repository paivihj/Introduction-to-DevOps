# DevOps Project by Päivi
This website was created as a project in the course Introduction to DevOps by Aalto University. It utilizes Hugo and GitHub Pages. I had used GitHub before, but GitHub Pages was a new thing to me, as well as Hugo. Actually, I had never heard of Hugo before this course. 

I am an ICT student at Haaga-Helia and work as a System Specialist in a company called Software Point. I started my ICT studies in the beginning of year 2020 and did not really know anything about ICT field before that. During my studies and especially at work I have often come up with the term “DevOps”, but did not really now exactly what it means. More about that on the Blog page and about me on the Who page (see links below)…
