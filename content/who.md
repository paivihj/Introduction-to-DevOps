# Who am I?

My name is PÃ¤ivi and I am an ICT student and System Specialist. I am almost done with my studies, just a few courses missing at the moment. This means I will graduate in the beginning of year 2022! Then I will be a Bachelor of Business Administration on ICT field. 

I have a previous degree on Chemical Engineering from Lappeenranta University of Technology. I worked in chemical industry for over ten year, but feeling it was really not my thing after all, I applied to school to learn programming. After about two years, programming is still amongst my favorite thing in ICT field, but I have learned that in addition to writing code, you need to know quite a lot about other things as well.
